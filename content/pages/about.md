## Backstory

This blog started in 2015 and was called *Are You Experiment?* focusing on guitars and pedals.

With the start of the channel [pitch patch](https://youtube.com/pitchpatch "pitch patch on YouTube"), the blog moved from [WordPress](https://wordpress.com "WordPress") to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Hugo") (an open-source static site generator) to improve performance, data protection, and privacy and avoid the constant maintenance hassle.

Today, this site is [open source](https://github.com/pitch-patch "pitch patch on GitHub") and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com "GitHub Pages"). To enable comments, we use a privacy-friendly and ad-free open-source solution called [Cactus Comments](https://github.com/pitch-patch "Cactus Comments"). Comments are stored in a [Matrix](https://matrix.org "Matrix") chatroom and you can also write, read, and delete comments with any Matrix client (e.g., [Element](https://element.io "Element")).
