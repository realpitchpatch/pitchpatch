## New Season - New Video

After a longer-than-usual-summer break, I decided to try something new. Experimenting with different camera angles and some new fonts, [the latest pitch patch video](https://youtu.be/DftcHiEREiA "Your Ambience Companion") is the first one with (almost) no hands!

## The Universal Audio UAFX Del-Verb (ft. Teenage Engineering OP-1 Field)

Universal Audioâ€™s Del-Verb wants to be your ambience companion.

Combining delay and reverb as two separate stereo instances with algorithms from the Golden Reverberator and Starlight the UAFX Del-Verb is a vintage delay and reverb powerhouse. The delay consists of a Memory-Man-style analog delay, a crisper digital delay, or a warm tape delay. The reverb offers a spring, plate, and 80's digital reverb.
