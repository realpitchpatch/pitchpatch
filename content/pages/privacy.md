# Privacy Policy

Last updated: May 6, 2023
This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.

Personal data (usually referred to just as „data“ below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there. Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the „GDPR“), „processing“ refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not. The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.

Our privacy policy is structured as follows:

1. Information about us as controllers of your data
2. The rights of users and data subjects
3. Information about data processing

## 1. Information about us as controllers of your data

The party responsible for this website (the „controller“) for purposes of data protection law and the controller’s data protection officer is: pitch patch, Boschetsrieder Str. 28, 81379 München, E-Mail: website@pitchpat.ch.

## 2. The rights of users and data subjects

With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);
to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.

## 3. Information about the data processing

Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.

### Cookies

#### Third-party functional cookies

We use third-party functional cookies on certain blog posts to enable comments. Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your browser, location data, or IP address. This processing allows us to offer a comment function. When you access the blog, IP addresses are transferred but not stored. On posts with a chat function, data such as the IP address are transmitted to [cactus.chat](https://cactus.chat "cactus.chat") to retrieve comments. By using the comment function a) a profile on [cactus.chat](https://cactus.chat "cactus.chat") is created, thereby data is stored in the browser that links the profile with the browser, or b) by logging in with an existing account, data is exchanged with the provider of the account and between the provider and [cactus.chat](https://cactus.chat "cactus.chat"). The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR, improving the functionality of our website.

#### Disabling cookies

You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary, depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or contact its maker for support. If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, the comment function on our site is disabled.

### Comments

We offer you the opportunity to post comments on our website, hereinafter referred to jointly as "comments." If you make use of the comment function, [cactus.chat](https://cactus.chat "cactus.chat") will process and publish your comment, the date and time you submitted it, and any pseudonym you may have used. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. In addition, your IP address is sent to [cactus.chat](https://cactus.chat "cactus.chat"). The IP address is processed because [cactus.chat](https://cactus.chat "cactus.chat") might have a legitimate interest in taking or supporting further action if your post infringes the rights of third parties and/or is otherwise unlawful. In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. The legitimate interest lies in any legal defense that may have to be mounted. Moreover, by processing the IP address, you have full control over your comments. You own your comments and can delete them as you wish.

### Instagram

To advertise our products and services as well as to communicate with interested parties or customers, we have a presence on the Instagram platform. On this social media platform, we are jointly responsible with Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Irland. The data protection officer of Instagram can be reached via [this contact form](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/540977946302970 "Instagram contact form"). We have defined the joint responsibility in an agreement regarding the respective obligations within the meaning of the GDPR. This agreement, which sets out the reciprocal obligations, is available at the [Facebook controller addendum](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum "Facebook controller addendum"). The legal basis for the processing of the resulting and subsequently disclosed personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, communication, sales, and promotion of our products and services. The legal basis may also be your consent per Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR granted to the platform operator. Per Art. 7 para. 3 GDPR, you may revoke this consent with the platform operator at any time with future effect. When accessing our online presence on the Instagram platform, Facebook Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland, a subsidiary of Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA as the operator of the platform in the EU will process your data (e.g. personal information, IP address, etc.). This data of the user is used for statistical information on the use of our company presence on Instagram. Facebook Ireland Ltd. uses this data for market research and advertising purposes as well as for the creation of user profiles. Based on these profiles, Facebook Ireland Ltd. can provide advertising both within and outside of Instagram based on your interests. If you are logged into Instagram at the time you access our site, Facebook Ireland Ltd. will also link this data to your user account. If you contact us via Instagram, the personal data your provide at that time will be used to process the request. We will delete this data once we have completely responded to your query, unless there are legal obligations to retain the data, such as for subsequent fulfillment of contracts. Facebook Ireland Ltd. might also set cookies when processing your data. If you do not agree to this processing, you have the option of preventing the installation of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser. Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. The instructions to do this depend on the browser and system being used. For Flash cookies, the processing cannot be prevented by the settings in your browser, but instead by making the appropriate settings in your Flash player. If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the functions of Instagram may be fully usable. Details on the processing activities, their suppression, and the deletion of the data processed by Instagram can be found in its [privacy policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875 "Instagram privacy policy").

YouTube is a service of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, a subsidiary of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA. We would like to point out that this might cause user data to be processed outside the European Union, particularly in the United States. This may increase risks for users that, for example, may make subsequent access to the user data more difficult. We also do not have access to this user data. Access is only available to YouTube. You can find more information in the [YouTube privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy "YouTube privacy policy").
