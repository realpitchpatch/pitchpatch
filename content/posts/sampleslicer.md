# Reshape Time with the Ginkosynthese SampleSlicer MKIII

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPjNoCF-HQw), we explore the **Ginkosynthese SampleSlicer MKIII**, a performance-oriented sampler and slicer for Eurorack. Designed for real-time use, it transforms loops into living, shifting patterns with voltage control over slice position and playback.

Whether you're mangling vocals, triggering rhythmic phrases, or sampling your modular on the fly, the SampleSlicer unlocks spontaneous, hands-on interaction with sound.

## What Makes SampleSlicer MKIII Special?

The SampleSlicer isn’t just a sampler, it’s a **timing instrument**:

- **Live Sampling**: Capture incoming audio directly and instantly.
- **Slice Control via CV or Triggers**: Rearrange or randomize slice playback in real time.
- **Rhythmic Playability**: Ideal for glitchy textures, stuttering beats, and loop mutation.

With CV addressing and gate-based slice triggering, this module excels in both structured and chaotic environments.
