## 5 things you need to build your own modular synth

Have you ever wondered how to get startet with Eurorack modular synths? The [latest episode of pitch patch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZTzaXC1OrM "latest episode of pitch patch") covers 5 things you need to build your own modular synth.

### 1. A case

A case that fits your modules and more. Mind two competing 1 U sizes! Intellijel 1 U is a scaled down 3 U to fit a 1 U row. Pulp Logic and Synthrotek use wider rails.

### 2. Power

Some cases come with power. Simply connect your modules. The red stripe of a 10 or 16-pin IDC connector indicates -12 V. Make sure the red band matches up to the small triangle marked on one side of the cable's connector! If your cases does not have an included power supply, you can use power modules such as the StrongPWR by [Konstant Lab](https://pitchpat.ch/konstantlab "Konstant Lab").

### 3. Screws

M3x6 mm screws work in most cases. Nylon washers or M3 Knurlies can save you from rack rash.

### 4. Cables

Patch cables should be 3.5 to 3.5 mm mono TS in about 15 cm increments up to the diagonal of your case. Use an adapter (cable) or output module to connect to your interface/PA/etc. Mind that Eurorack levels can be 10 VPP (between â€“5 and +5 V).

### 5. Modules

Depending on your goal, you will need some modules. As with most things in life, you should know what you want.
