## A Love Letter to Blank Panels

Big T Music sent me a little box that changes everything (at least for me). I have spent a lot of time finding the perfect case sizes and modules for my past videos. I wanted to keep it as minimal as possible without sacrificing too much functionality. And, of course, I wanted there to be no gaps! But now that I have Gap Banishers (and yes, they look even more beautiful in person). I might even make gaps on purpose to make my racks look tidier.

Gap Banisher blank panels for Eurorack modular synthesizers are available in different sizes and are designed to stack above, below, and alongside one another, forming a continuous traditional Japanese Seigaiha pattern to fill any gaps in your rack. Most of them feature a different design on the backside.
